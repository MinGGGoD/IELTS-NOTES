There was a bar opened in my hometown recently, just close to my home, which is less than 2km. It's a spot that attracts both college students and grown-ups looking to unwind. And the bar sells whiskies of various brands and different vintages, as well as cocktails crafted on-site. Of course, they also provide snacks to complement your drinks.

As I mentioned earlier, besides office workers stopping by for a drink after work, there are also some college students will hang out there on weekends. The reason for this phenomenon might be because my hometown is a fourth-tier city where the cost of living is relatively low. As a result, the prices of drinks in the bar are not very high, which making it affordable for college students.

Nowadays, this bar has become the most popular spot for relaxation and leisure in my neighborhood. So I reckon if this bar introduces new cocktail recipes and promotes them regularly, it's gonna get more popular in the future.



### 2. Describe a place away from your home and you want to visit in the future

> Where you would like to go
>
> When you would like to go
>
> Who you want to go with
>
> And explain why you want to visit the place

The place that I most want to visit is Sphere at The Venetian Resort, also known as MSG Sphere, located in Las Vegas. About 2 months ago, I saw videos about it on TikTok, and I think it can give me an extraordinary and unforgettable experience.

And I plan to visit MSG Sphere in Las Vegas with my childhood friend during the Chinese New Year holiday this year. We'll enjoy a show inside the sphere, have some delicious food, and, of course, take lots of photos to share on social media.
