###### 普通人

Person is Leo, he was my direct supervisor at the first company in my career.

Our first meeting was during an interview, around April 2017, he was the interviewer.

And at that time, he wore a pair of black-framed glasses and had a round face, which made him appear approachable and easygoing.

At the beginning of the interview, I performed poorly because I was a rookie at that time and was too nervous. But he kept encouraging and guiding me, showing great patience throughout the interview. And with his help, I could demonstrate my real abilities and successfully passed the interview.

In daily work, he often helps colleagues identify the direction to address problems. He also provides me with many useful suggestions for my career planning, and these suggestions still have an impact on me to this day.

As for why he is so willing to help, I'm not very sure. I guess  it could be due to his natural personality or perhaps because he has also experienced the process of growing from a rookie to a leader.
